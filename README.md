# Ecco the Dolphin Password Generator
A password generator for the Sega Genesis and Sega CD versions of Ecco the Dolphin.

# How Was This Made?

This password generator was built by disaaembling the games code and porting it from 68000 assembly to Javascript.
Each version of the game had its own password system that had to be studied and incorporated into the generator.
For example, the Japanese version of Ecco the Dolphin is not compatible with the US version due to tweaks in the 
password algorithm. 

As a little bit of extra spice, the ripple effect used on the password screen animation is also an algorithm
ported from the original games. 

# Features

- Generates and decodes passwords for the Sega Genesis and Sega CD versions of Ecco the Dolphin.
